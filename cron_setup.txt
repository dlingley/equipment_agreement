# Equipment Agreement Log Management - Cron Setup Instructions

To set up automated log management, add the following line to your crontab:

# Run log management daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /Volumes/alma$/equipment_agreement/manage_logs.sh

To install the cron job:

1. Open your crontab for editing:
   crontab -e

2. Add the above line to the file

3. Save and exit the editor

The script will:
- Rotate logs that exceed 10MB in size
- Keep up to 5 backup files
- Remove archived logs older than 30 days
- Maintain a separate manage_logs.log file for tracking the rotation process
- Keep the manage_logs.log file from growing too large by retaining only the last 1000 lines

Log Management Strategy:
- Debug logs use copy-truncate strategy to avoid file handle issues
- Check-in logs use monthly consolidation to preserve historical data
- All archived logs are organized by month for easy access
- Calendar view and statistics in admin.php will work seamlessly with both current and archived logs

To modify configuration:
1. Edit manage_logs.sh to change:
   - MAX_SIZE (default: 10MB)
   - MAX_BACKUPS (default: 5)
   - RETENTION_DAYS (default: 30)

2. Or run manually with different parameters:
   ./manage_logs.sh --max-size 20 --max-backups 10 --retention-days 60

Archived logs are stored in:
- /path/to/logs/archives/debug_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log.gz (for debug logs)
- /path/to/logs/archives/checkin_YYYY_MM.csv (for check-in logs)
