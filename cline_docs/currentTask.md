# Current Task Status

## Current Objectives
- Address critical security concerns in configuration
- Complete codebase analysis and documentation
- Plan secure system enhancements
- Maintain consistent timestamp handling

## Context
Analysis of core files has revealed:
- Robust logging system implementation with proper timezone handling
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Alma API integration
- SMTP email capabilities
- Standardized timezone management across files

### Critical Security Concerns
Found in config.php:
- Exposed API keys in plaintext
- Hardcoded admin/user credentials
- Sensitive SMTP configuration
- Need for environment variable implementation

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Security Improvements:
   - [ ] Move sensitive data to environment variables:
     - [ ] Alma API key
     - [ ] Authentication credentials
     - [ ] SMTP configuration
   - [ ] Implement secure credential storage
   - [ ] Update configuration management

2. Review remaining core files:
   - [x] config.php (COMPLETED - requires security updates)
   - [ ] login.php (authentication implementation)
   - [x] confirm.php (COMPLETED - timezone standardization implemented)
   - [ ] admin.php (administrative interface)
   - [x] success.php (COMPLETED - timezone standardization implemented)
   - [x] index.php (COMPLETED - timezone standardization implemented)

3. Security Assessment:
   - [ ] Analyze authentication mechanisms
   - [ ] Review session management
   - [ ] Evaluate input validation
   - [ ] Check for CSRF vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Audit API usage security
   - [ ] Review email system security

4. System Improvements:
   - [ ] Implement secure configuration management
   - [x] Enhance error handling and logging
     - [x] Standardize timezone handling
     - [x] Ensure consistent timestamp formats
   - [ ] Improve input validation
   - [ ] Add CSRF protection
   - [ ] Implement secure API communication

References tasks from projectRoadmap.md:
- Secure user authentication system
- Data privacy and security compliance
- Equipment agreement management interface
- Admin dashboard functionality
- Logging system improvements

## Current Progress
- [x] Initial documentation structure created
- [x] Main entry point (index.php) analyzed and updated
- [x] Configuration system (config.php) reviewed
- [x] Logging system documented and enhanced
  - [x] Standardized timezone handling
  - [x] Verified timestamp consistency
- [x] Authentication flow mapped
- [ ] Security improvements pending
- [ ] System enhancement implementation pending

## Immediate Focus
Priority shifted to security concerns:
1. Design secure configuration management system
2. Plan credential storage solution
3. Review authentication implementation in login.php
4. Document security improvement implementation plan

## Recent System Updates
1. Timezone Standardization:
   - All timestamps now use America/New_York timezone
   - Consistent timezone setting across all files
   - Debug and checkin logs write Eastern Time timestamps
   - Config-driven timezone management

## Security Improvement Plan
1. Environment Variables:
   - Create .env file structure
   - Move sensitive data to environment variables
   - Implement environment variable loading system

2. Configuration Management:
   - Separate configuration types (app, security, api)
   - Implement secure credential retrieval
   - Add configuration validation
   - Document configuration dependencies

3. Authentication Enhancement:
   - Implement secure password hashing
   - Add rate limiting
   - Enhance session security
