## Current Task: Project Migration & Initial Feature Set - COMPLETE

**Status:** Completed

**Summary of Work Done (Django Implementation):**

The initial migration of the Equipment Loan Agreement system from PHP to Django is now complete. The following core functionalities and improvements have been implemented:

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Django project (`equipment_agreement_project`) and application (`agreement_app`) created.
    *   Directory structure established for templates, static files, and application logic.

2.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Implemented `python-decouple` for managing settings via a `.env` file, separating configuration from code.
    *   `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG` status, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and placeholder settings for Alma API and Email are configured through `.env`.

3.  **Database Models (`models.py`):**
    *   `CheckinLog`: Records user agreements (Purdue ID, timestamp, user group, visit count).
    *   `DebugLogEntry`: For application-level logging (timestamp, level, message).
    *   Migrations created and applied.

4.  **User Authentication (`django.contrib.auth`):**
    *   Utilized Django's built-in authentication system.
    *   Login and logout functionality implemented.
    *   `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`, `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, and `LOGIN_URL` configured in `settings.py`.
    *   Admin user created for testing and administration.

5.  **Core Agreement Workflow:**
    *   **Purdue ID Input Form (`PurdueIdForm`):** A simple form to capture the user's Purdue ID on the main page (`index` view).
    *   **Confirmation Page (`agreement_confirm_view`):**
        *   Displays (mocked) user details fetched based on the Purdue ID (stored in session).
        *   Presents the equipment loan agreement text.
        *   Allows users to confirm or cancel.
        *   On confirmation, logs the agreement to `CheckinLog` and creates a `DebugLogEntry`.
        *   Placeholder for future Alma API calls and email notifications.
    *   **Success Page (`agreement_success_view`):** Displays a confirmation message after successful agreement submission.

6.  **Admin Features:**
    *   **Django Admin Integration:** `CheckinLog` and `DebugLogEntry` models are registered and accessible via the Django admin interface (`/admin/`) with custom list displays and filters.
    *   **CSV Log Download (`download_checkin_logs_csv` view):** Staff users can download a CSV file of all `CheckinLog` entries.
    *   **Admin Reports Page (`admin_reports_view`):**
        *   Displays a table of monthly usage statistics by user group.
        *   Includes a bar chart (using Chart.js) visualizing monthly usage.
        *   Features a calendar view highlighting daily check-in counts for the current month.
    *   **Session Keep-Alive (`session_keep_alive_view`):** An endpoint for authenticated users to refresh their session.

7.  **Templates and Static Files:**
    *   Base template (`base.html`) providing consistent layout, header with logo, and user status (login/logout/admin links).
    *   Specific templates for each view (`index.html`, `login.html`, `agreement_confirm.html`, `agreement_success.html`, `admin_reports.html`).
    *   Static files (CSS, images) are served correctly.

8.  **URL Configuration:**
    *   Project-level `urls.py` includes paths for the admin interface, authentication (`accounts/`), and the `agreement_app`.
    *   App-level `urls.py` (for `agreement_app`) defines routes for all application views with appropriate naming for use with `{% url %}` tags.

9.  **Unit Tests (`agreement_app/tests.py`):**
    *   Basic tests for models (`CheckinLog`, `DebugLogEntry`).
    *   Tests for the `PurdueIdForm`.
    *   View tests for the core agreement workflow (`index`, `agreement_confirm_view`, `agreement_success_view`).
    *   View tests for admin features (`download_checkin_logs_csv`, `admin_reports_view`, `session_keep_alive_view`), including authentication and authorization checks.

**Next Steps / Future Work (as outlined in `projectRoadmap.md`):**

*   **Full Alma API Integration:**
    *   Implement live user data fetching.
    *   Implement updating Alma user notes with agreement status.
*   **Production Email Configuration:**
    *   Configure SMTP settings in `.env` for a production email service.
    *   Test email sending functionality.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Prepare for production deployment (e.g., using Gunicorn/uWSGI, Nginx).
    *   Configure HTTPS.
*   **Further Enhancements & Refinements:**
    *   Implement any remaining features from the original PHP application or new requirements.
    *   Improve UI/UX based on user feedback.
    *   Enhance reporting and data analysis capabilities.
    *   Address accessibility requirements.
*   **Security Hardening:**
    *   Conduct a full security review.
    *   Implement rate limiting for login attempts.
    *   Address any remaining items from "Critical Security Goals" if applicable (e.g., advanced configuration validation).
*   **Accessibility Review:** Ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

This concludes the initial development phase of migrating the application to Django and establishing its core features. The project is now ready for further development of external integrations and preparation for production.
