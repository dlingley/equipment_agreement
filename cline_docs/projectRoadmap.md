# Equipment Agreement System Project Roadmap

## Critical Security Goals (High Priority)
- [x] Implement secure configuration management
  - [x] Move sensitive data to environment variables (`.env` with `python-decouple`)
  - [x] Secure credential storage (Django's default password hashing)
  - [ ] Configuration validation system (Further hardening can be done)
- [x] Enhance authentication security
  - [x] Implement password hashing (Django default)
  - [ ] Add rate limiting (Future enhancement)
  - [x] Improve session security (Django default session management, keep-alive implemented)
- [ ] Secure API communication (For future Alma integration)
  - [x] Protect API keys (Stored in `.env`)
  - [ ] Implement secure API calls (Using HTTPS for Alma - when implemented)
  - [ ] Add request validation (For Alma API - when implemented)

## Project Goals
- [x] Implement secure user authentication system
  - [x] Role-based access control (`is_staff` for admin features)
  - [x] Secure session management (Django default + keep-alive)
  - [x] Password security (Django default)
- [x] Create equipment agreement management interface
  - [x] User-friendly form submission (Purdue ID -> Confirmation -> Success)
  - [x] Agreement validation (Basic form validation)
  - [x] Status tracking (via `CheckinLog` model)
- [x] Develop admin dashboard for oversight
  - [x] Agreement management (Viewing logs, CSV download)
  - [x] User management (Django Admin)
  - [x] System monitoring (Basic reports page with chart and calendar)
- [ ] Ensure data privacy and security compliance (Ongoing)
  - [ ] Data encryption (Consider for sensitive data if not already covered by DB)
  - [x] Secure data storage (Using Django ORM with SQLite)
  - [x] Access logging (`CheckinLog`, `DebugLogEntry`, Admin actions)
- [x] Implement user-friendly interface
  - [x] Responsive design (Basic structure provided)
  - [x] Clear user feedback (Implemented for form submissions)
  - [ ] Accessibility compliance (To be reviewed and improved)
- [x] Create confirmation and success workflows
  - [ ] Email notifications (Placeholder, uses console backend)
  - [x] Status updates (Session management, database logs)
  - [x] Success confirmation page

## Key Features Implemented
- User authentication and authorization (Django built-in)
- Equipment agreement form submission workflow
- Admin interface for `CheckinLog` and `DebugLogEntry` models
- Admin reports page with:
    - Monthly usage table
    - Usage graph (Chart.js)
    - Check-in calendar view
- CSV download of check-in logs
- Session keep-alive functionality
- Configuration management via `.env` files (using `python-decouple`)
- Basic logging to database (`DebugLogEntry`)

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Secure configuration management implemented (using `.env`)
- [x] Sensitive data properly protected (SECRET_KEY in `.env`)
- [x] Secure login/logout functionality (Django auth)
- [x] Working equipment agreement submission process
- [x] Admin ability to manage agreements (view logs, download CSV, view reports)
- [x] Proper form validation and data handling
- [x] Responsive design (Basic structure in place)
- [x] Security best practices implemented (Django defaults, CSRF, XSS protection)
- [ ] Email notification system functioning (Currently console output, needs SMTP setup)
- [x] Comprehensive logging system operational (`CheckinLog`, `DebugLogEntry`, server logs)
- [x] All timestamps properly set to UTC (Django default)

## Future Enhancements & Next Steps
- **Full Alma API Integration:**
    - Implement live user data fetching.
    - Implement updating Alma user notes with agreement status.
- **Production Email Configuration:**
    - Configure SMTP settings in `.env` for a production email service.
    - Test email sending functionality.
- **Deployment:**
    - Prepare for production deployment (e.g., Gunicorn, Nginx).
    - Configure HTTPS.
- **Advanced Features:**
    - User self-registration (if required).
    - Password reset functionality (Django built-in, needs template customization).
    - More detailed reporting and filtering options.
    - Enhanced UI/UX based on feedback.
- **Security Hardening:**
    - Implement rate limiting for login attempts.
    - Conduct a thorough security audit.
    - Address any remaining items from "Critical Security Goals" if applicable (e.g., advanced configuration validation).
- **Accessibility Review:** Ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

## Completed Milestones
- [x] Initial project setup (Django project and app creation).
- [x] Basic HTML templates and static file serving.
- [x] Implemented user authentication (login, logout, staff access).
- [x] Created equipment agreement form and workflow (Purdue ID input, confirmation, success pages).
- [x] Implemented data models (`CheckinLog`, `DebugLogEntry`) and database migrations.
- [x] Integrated models with Django Admin.
- [x] Implemented CSV download for check-in logs.
- [x] Implemented admin reports page with table, chart, and calendar.
- [x] Implemented session keep-alive functionality.
- [x] Configured settings using `python-decouple` and `.env` file.
- [x] Initial unit tests for models, forms, and views.
- [x] Documentation update (`codebaseSummary.md`, `techStack.md`, `projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`).

## Security Improvement Timeline (Revised)
1.  **Completed:**
    *   Environment variable implementation (using `python-decouple`).
    *   Secure credential storage (Django's default password hashing).
    *   Basic CSRF/XSS protection via Django defaults.
2.  **Next Steps (Short-term):**
    *   Configure HTTPS for production deployment.
    *   Implement rate limiting for login and other sensitive actions.
    *   Securely manage Alma API key when implementing full integration.
    *   Set up and configure a production-ready email service with proper credentials management.
3.  **Medium-term:**
    *   Comprehensive security audit.
    *   Implement more granular permissions if needed beyond staff/superuser.
    *   Review and implement further OWASP Top 10 recommendations.
    *   Configuration validation system (if deemed necessary beyond basic checks).

This project has successfully migrated from its original PHP implementation to a Django-based application, laying a solid foundation for future development and deployment.
